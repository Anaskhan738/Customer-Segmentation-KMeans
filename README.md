# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers dataset to group customers based on income and spending habits.

 Project Overview:

This project groups mall customers into different segments based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior and create better marketing strategies.

 Dataset:

Name: Mall_Customers.csv
Rows: 200 customers
Columns: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

 Steps in the Project:

Load the Dataset – Import the CSV file.
Data Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the data.
Data Analysis – Understand income vs. spending patterns.
Finding Optimum Clusters – Use Elbow Method (WCSS).
K-Means Clustering – Group customers into clusters.
Visualization – Plot clusters to show customer groups.

 Tools & Libraries:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

 Results:

Customers are divided into clusters such as:
High Income, High Spending
High Income, Low Spending
Low Income, High Spending
Low Income, Low Spending
These clusters help create customer personas for targeted marketing.

 How to Run:

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).
Run all cells step by step.
